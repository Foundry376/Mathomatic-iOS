# This shell script runs Mathomatic with the GNU m4 macro pre-processor so that
# standard math functions such as sqrt(x), sin(x), etc. may be easily entered.
# Hyperbolic trig has "h" appended, like sinh(x) for hyperbolic sine.
# Only works with GNU software.
# See file "functions.m4" for the complete list of supported functions,
# or type "man rmath" at the shell prompt.

# Usage: matho [ input_files ]
