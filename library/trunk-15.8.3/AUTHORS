There are many individuals maintaining Mathomatic ports. Thank you very much
for creating, supporting, and sponsoring the Mathomatic ports for all these
years.

Thanks to all people who have contributed code and time to the Mathomatic
project:
  2010 Simon Geard for better and more readable code command code.  :-)
  2010 Michael Pogue of Sun Microsystems for help on compiling under Solaris.
  2010 Jonathan Stark for the original cmake file "CMakeLists.txt".
  2011 Doug Snead for the MinGW color mode code for cmd.exe and command.com.
  2012 Doug Snead creates and sells a fancy Android version with a GUI.

Thanks to all the wonderful people that have been testing, contributing, and
donating to the Mathomatic project and encouraging me on; many are not listed
here. If you think you belong in this list, please let George Gesslein II
know. I will mention anyone that has contributed to or guided the Mathomatic
project, that wishes to be mentioned here. Please indicate how you would like
your entry to appear (website?, email address?).

And late thanks to Dennis M. Ritchie, whose work to design and create the
original C language and compiler made Mathomatic and our life possible. I
even learned C from his book.

				Sincerely,
				George Gesslein II
