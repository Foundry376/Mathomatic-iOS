                           Known bugs in Mathomatic
                           ------------------------

Factorial bug:
     Try "factor number 17!", 17! gives wrong answer 355687428096001, should
be 355687428096000 (off by 1). This bug is because of slightly faulty gamma
functions that come with the standard C math library. Can be fixed by
compiling with -DNOGAMMA on the cc command line. This will make factorial
integer only.
     "factor number 18!" and higher don't work because the maximum safely
representable integer for double precision floating point is 15 digits long.
This is not a bug.

Absolute values and complex number problems:
     Absolute values and the imaginary unit (i) do not always remain intact
after being manipulated with the standard rules of algebra. For example, 1/i
correctly simplifies to -i, changing the sign of the result. So the fraction
command and other possible operations may give wrong results due to differing
sign after manipulations. The simplify command should always work, but it is
not guaranteed for these.
     The solve command may have a problem too, but using the verify option
should check that the result of solving absolute value or complex number
equations is 100% correct.

Solving modulus equations:
     May result in garbage, due to incomplete modulus operator solving code.
I could just disable it, but I choose to research it at a later time, because
it does sometimes work nicely. Again, the "solve verify" option tells if you
should trust the results.
