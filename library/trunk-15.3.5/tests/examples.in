; This is a line comment.  This file shows some simple examples of Mathomatic usage.

; Equations are entered by just typing them in:
c^2=a^2+b^2 ; The Pythagorean theorem, "c" squared equals "a" squared plus "b" squared.
; The entered equation becomes the current equation and is displayed.
display ; The display command by itself displays the current equation again.
; The current equation can be solved by simply typing in a variable name:
c ; which is shorthand for the solve command.  Solve for variable "c".
; "sign" variables are special two-valued variables that may only be +1 or -1.
b ; Solve for variable "b".
; To output programming language code, use the code command:
code ; C language code is the default.

code java ; Mathomatic can also generate Java

code python ; and Python code.

; **********************************************************************
a=b+1/b ; Enter another equation; this is actually a quadratic equation.
0 ; Solve for zero.
unfactor ; Expand, showing that this is a quadratic polynomial equation in "b".
b ; Solve for variable "b".
a ; Solve back for "a" and we should get the original equation.
simplify ; The simplify command makes expressions simpler and prettier.
; **********************************************************************
; Mathomatic is also handy as an advanced calculator.
; Expressions without variables entered at the main prompt are instantly evaluated:
2+3
4/6 ; Fractions are always reduced to their simplest form:
2^.5 ; The square root of 2, rounded to the default 14 digits:
; **********************************************************************
; Symbolic logarithms like log(x) are currently not implemented in Mathomatic.
27^y=9 ; An example that uses numeric logarithms.
solve verify y ; Solve for y, verifying the result.
; **********************************************************************
0=2x^2-3x-20 ; A simple quadratic equation, to show how the calculate command works.
solve verify x ; Solve for x, plugging the results into the original equation to verify.
calculate ; Expand "sign" variables and approximate the RHS (Right-Hand Side).
; The calculate command also lets you plug values into a formula with variables, if any.
display; Display the current equation, showing that it was not modified by calculate.
