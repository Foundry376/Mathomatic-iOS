              -------------------------------------------------

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.0 TO BRING IT UP TO V14.0.1:

Code and documentation cleanup.

Disallow variable name "all" in expressions.  "all" means all normal variables and is a reserved word now.

4/25/08 - Set command parser now reports errors properly.

4/28/08 - More correct simplification restriction added: (x^n)^m remains unsimplified unless "symbolic" option is used.
          This was documented but not fully implemented.  You need to use "simplify symbolic" to simplify like before.
          Note that this caused expression complication, which is fixed in V14.2.2 or by using "simplify symbolic".

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.1:

4/30/08 - The calculate command user interface was corrected.

5/4/08 - Added "simplify sign" command option, which conveniently expands all "sign" variables and simplifies.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.2:

Code and comments cleanup.

5/16/08 - Added "derivative nosimplify" command option, which does no simplification after differentiating.
          Fixed the taylor command to work with larger expressions with more derivatives by simplifying better.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.3:

Cleanup.

5/19/08 - Fixed for less floating point round-off error.

5/27/08 - Author's email address changed to "georgegesslein@gmail.com".

5/31/08 - Fixed to simplify sign variables better, sign^(1/3) now simplifies to sign.
          Added "solve verify" command option, which verifies the results of the solve command.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.4:

Cleanup.

Improved the "solve verify" command option by simplifying more and used it in the tests and demos.

6/14/08 - Added "Divide by zero" warning message whenever that happens.  Result still generates infinity.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.5:

6/18/08 - Improved divide command and verification of floating point GCDs.

6/19/08 - Improved "solve verify" even more, displaying a warning if verification is not needed.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.6:

Cleanup and added some options to make reading the source code more rewarding.

6/26/08 - The "set finance" option now parenthesizes negative numbers to give them emphasis.

7/2/08 - Bug fix: code command now parenthesizes negative numbers so that -2**x works the same with Python.

7/5/08 - Readline history file enabled as "~/.history", and fixed possible bug in readline initialization.

Mathomatic version 14.0.7 released 2008-07-06

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.7:

Documentation and code cleanup.

7/8/08 - Optimize more by changing gcc option "-O" to "-O2" for all builds.

7/11/08 - Fixed inconsistent evaluation in the "derivative nosimplify" command.

Mathomatic version 14.0.8 released 2008-07-18

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.8:

Code cleanup.

7/20/08 - Added optional installation of a shell script that allows using trig functions: "make m4install".
          Limit command no longer substitutes, it now uses only one method (solve) for teaching purposes;
          see "tests/how_limit_works.in" for the current method of finding limits.

7/21/08 - The "set special_variable_character" option was changed to allow multiple characters.  These
          characters can be used in any variable name, unless they have other meanings.
          Disallowed [] as parentheses characters, so that they can be used in variable names to make arrays.

7/23/08 - "solve verify" was sometimes saying nothing when the solve failed, fixed to say "Solve failed.".

7/27/08 - Fixed some critical command output redirection bugs and made read input bold in HTML mode.

Mathomatic version 14.1.0 released 2008-07-27

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.0:

More tidying up of everything.

Improved readline history storage and limited it to 500 entries, previously it was unlimited.

8/8/08 - Fixed a bug in the fraction command: the resulting algebraic fraction was not being fully reduced.

8/9/08 - Removed all of C type "long long" arithmetic from the main Mathomatic program,
         resulting in smaller executable.  "long long" types are only supported in C99.
         Tweaked startup messages and made quadratic solving consistent with other solving.
         Solving only unfactors as much as it needs to.

8/10/08 - Added "unfactor quick" command option.

Mathomatic version 14.1.2 released 2008-08-10

Mathomatic version 14.1.3 released 2008-08-13

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.3:

8/13/08 - The calculate command now reports the number of solutions.

8/14/08 - Made some big improvements and bug fixes to simplification, if only someone had reported bugs earlier!
          A major, long-standing simplify command malfunction has been fixed, but it runs a little slower.
          The simplify command is now logically correct and appears to work nicely now, please tell me if not.

Mathomatic version 14.1.4 released 2008-08-14

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.4:

Cleanup and beautification.

8/19/08 - Added "HANDHELD" C preprocessor define for when compiling for hand-helds, like the Nintendo DS.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.5:

8/25/08 - Added "tests/electronics.in" Mathomatic input file; contains simple electrical formulas.
          When using m4, corrected ceil(x) function and added cbrt(x) (cube root function) in "m4/functions.m4".

9/02/08 - General internal routine get_constant() in "complex.c" was finished perfectly,
          making less need to ever approximate constants.
          Some corrections to the makefile were made, "make install" and "make m4install" were improved.

9/06/08 - Optimized "tests/linear.in" and "tests/poly.in" to make "make test" run in half the time.

11/26/08 - "set preserve_roots" option renamed to "set preserve_surds"; Functionality remains the same.

11/29/08 - Created "cproto.h" with the cproto utility and added it to the source distribution;
           swap it with "proto.h" to compile Mathomatic with -Wall with no warnings.

Mathomatic version 14.2.4 released 2008-11-30

12/06/08 - Removed a part of modulus simplification that sometimes gave a completely wrong answer.

Mathomatic version 14.2.5 released 2008-12-06

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.2.5:

12/06/08 - Renamed boolean "set true_modulus" option to integer "modulus_mode" and added another mode:
           0 means result is the same sign as the dividend; 1 means result is the same sign as the divisor;
           Currently set to 2 for an always positive or zero result of modulus, as was the default before.

12/08/08 - Allow ANSI color mode to display readably when terminal emulator has a white background
           by removing the color white in the text output.

12/13/08 - Restored modulus simplification with a fix for wrong answers like x%(x^x) simplifying to 0.

2/6/09 - Removed erroneous lsqrt() routine obtained from Wikipedia, so that matho-sumsq works properly now.

2/7/09 - Disable pause command when appropriate (when input not a tty and for symbolic math library).

2/8/09 - Polished up educational example scripts in "tests" directory.

Mathomatic version 14.3.2 released 2009-02-09

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.3.2:

Cleanup and bugfixes and code simplification.

Mathomatic version 14.3.4 released 2009-03-04

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.3.4:

3/9/09 - Found the correct formulas for solving the general cubic equation on Wikipedia,
         so "tests/cubic.in" always gives correct answers now.

3/12/09 - Tweak made to simplify result beautifier: factoring priority only given to real variables now,
          special constant variables pi#, e#, and i# have no effect and behave like any constant now.

3/15/09 - Corrected and improved parse_complex() C function for more complex number functionality
          and a bug fix.

3/18/09 - Added "set negate_highest_precedence" option, which allows the negate operator to be the
          lower precedence of times and divide, like it is in Maxima and most other math programs.

Mathomatic version 14.3.5 released 2009-03-18

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.3.5:

More improvements to the documentation were made.

3/24/09 - Made "set no autosolve" mode more useful by making it solve if a solve variable is entered
          with an equals sign.  This allows easy entry of both single variable expressions (with no =)
          and solve variables (with =) while in this mode.

3/27/09 - Selecting equations by entering the equation number was returning with error if the equation
          space was empty.  Fixed, you can now select any previously allocated equation space.

Mathomatic version 14.3.6 released 2009-03-29

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.3.6:

Many minor code and documentation corrections were done, in addition to the following:

Perfected the user interface for the sum, product, and integrate commands.

4/2/09 - Added the proper LGPL license preamble for all Mathomatic files in new file "license.h".
         The license remains the same.

4/4/09 - Renamed m4 Mathomatic script from "math" to "matho" to make it unique.
         m4 Mathomatic should now be suitable for packaging with the command "make m4install"
         instead of "make install".  Then typing "rmath" runs "matho" with readline support,
         allowing trig and other standard functions to be entered and edited.
         Requires GNU m4 and rlwrap programs.

Mathomatic version 14.3.7 released 2009-04-08

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.3.7:

More improvements to the documentation were made.  The READMEs were clarified.

4/10/09 - Compilation define HANDHELD was corrected to work properly on handheld devices.
          UNIX define was corrected so that Mathomatic will compile without it.

4/12/09 - Restored initial full simplify in the limit command for better results,
          that was unintentionally removed in version 14.1.0.

4/16/09 - Fixed an endless loop in simplification; results look better, too.

Mathomatic version 14.4.0 released 2009-04-17

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.4.0:

Documention and tests cleanup.

4/25/09 - Added "set save" command, which makes all current session options permanent,
          by saving them in "~/.mathomaticrc".  "set no save" removes this file.

4/30/09 - Added "mathomatic -s" option, which stands for secure mode.  This is a run-time option
          that disallows shelling out and writing files, and was created for use on public servers
          that can't use the SECURE compile-time define.

Mathomatic version 14.4.1 released 2009-05-02

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.4.1:

General cleanup.

5/6/09 - Doubled the default maximum mathematical expression size to allow larger expressions.

Mathomatic version 14.4.3 released 2009-05-25

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.4.3:

5/25/09 - Small fix made to fraction command and "simplify fraction" for better looking fractions.

5/26/09 - Added a "simplify quickest" command option, which does no unfactoring nor factoring.

5/28/09 - Made full simplification more efficient and simpler by cutting out unnecessary loops.

5/31/09 - Improved the divide command and enabled its use in the symbolic math library.
          Enabled code and variables commands in library, too.
          Currently, library output of these 3 commands can only be gathered by redirecting to a file.

6/2/09 - Added "set autoselect" and "set auto" options.  Use "set no auto" to always store
         entered expressions into equation spaces, unless it is a command.

Mathomatic version 14.4.4 released 2009-06-03

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.4.4:

General cleanup and addition of helpful descriptive text.

6/9/09 - "primes/mult" improved and renamed to "primes/matho-mult",
         so you can install as a unique program, if you wish.
         "primorial 1" works now, too.
         Roots command enabled in the symbolic math library.

6/10/09 - Fixed factor command parameter handling and results, it was not user friendly.
          Also fixed factor command for consistent behavior in the symbolic math library.

6/14/09 - Allow separate install of Mathomatic binaries and documentation in makefile.
