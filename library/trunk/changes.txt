              --------------------------------------------------

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.8.9 TO BRING IT UP TO VERSION 12.9.0:

Documentation and code cleanup.

3/6/08 - Added demo "tests/circles.in", completes in 1 second!

3/7/08 - Made all error text the color red when color mode is enabled.

3/8/08 - Made "set true_modulus" the default.

3/13/08 - Implemented integral divide operator "//" which divides and truncates result to an integer.
          This operator is handy for doing integer arithmetic.

3/16/08 - Made all warning text the color yellow.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.9.0:

3/27/08 - Deleted outdated "doc/notes.html".

3/29/08 - Set command allows the following option prefix words: no, not, off, false, yes, on, true.

3/30/08 - Updated matho-primes to work with architectures that don't support long double.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.9.1:

Some minor corrections were made.

4/5/08 - Turned off readline file name completion, tab is now just a tab.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V12.9.2:

4/20/08 - Read set options in either "~/.mathomaticrc" or "mathomatic.rc" when starting up under Cygwin.

4/23/08 - A major fix was made to the simplify command, it was not expanding fractions enough.
          *Note that this simplify fix was done wrong and is now corrected in version 14.1.4

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.0:

Code and documentation cleanup.

Disallow variable name "all" in expressions.  "all" means all normal variables and is a reserved word now.

4/25/08 - Set command parser now reports errors properly.

4/28/08 - More correct simplification restriction added: (x^n)^m remains unsimplified unless "symbolic" option is used.
          This was documented but not fully implemented.  You need to use "simplify symbolic" to simplify like before.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.1:

4/30/08 - The calculate command user interface was corrected.

5/4/08 - Added "simplify sign" command option, which conveniently expands all "sign" variables and simplifies.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.2:

Code and comments cleanup.

5/16/08 - Added "derivative nosimplify" command option, which does no simplification after differentiating.
          Fixed the taylor command to work with larger expressions with more derivatives by simplifying better.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.3:

Cleanup.

5/19/08 - Fixed for less floating point round-off error.

5/27/08 - Author's email address changed to "georgegesslein@gmail.com".

5/31/08 - Fixed to simplify sign variables better, sign^(1/3) now simplifies to sign.
          Added "solve verify" command option, which verifies the results of the solve command.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.4:

Cleanup.

Improved the "solve verify" command option by simplifying more and used it in the tests and demos.

6/14/08 - Added "Divide by zero" warning message whenever that happens.  Result still generates infinity.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.5:

6/18/08 - Improved divide command and verification of floating point GCDs.

6/19/08 - Improved "solve verify" even more, displaying a warning if verification is not needed.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.6:

Cleanup and added some options to make reading the source code more rewarding.

6/26/08 - The "set finance" option now parenthesizes negative numbers to give them emphasis.

7/2/08 - Bug fix: code command now parenthesizes negative numbers so that -2**x works the same with Python.

7/5/08 - Readline history file enabled as "~/.history", and fixed possible bug in readline initialization.

Mathomatic version 14.0.7 released 2008-07-06

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.7:

Documentation and code cleanup.

7/8/08 - Optimize more by changing gcc option "-O" to "-O2" for all builds.

7/11/08 - Fixed inconsistent evaluation in the "derivative nosimplify" command.

Mathomatic version 14.0.8 released 2008-07-18

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.0.8:

Code cleanup.

7/20/08 - Added optional installation of a shell script that allows using trig functions: "make m4install".
          Limit command no longer substitutes, it now uses only one method (solve) for teaching purposes;
          see "tests/how_limit_works.in" for the current method of finding limits.

7/21/08 - The "set special_variable_character" option was changed to allow multiple characters.  These
          characters can be used in any variable name, unless they have other meanings.
          Disallowed [] as parentheses characters, so that they can be used in variable names to make arrays.

7/23/08 - "solve verify" was sometimes saying nothing when the solve failed, fixed to say "Solve failed.".

7/27/08 - Fixed some critical command output redirection bugs and made read input bold in HTML mode.

Mathomatic version 14.1.0 released 2008-07-27

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.0:

More tidying up of everything.

Improved readline history storage and limited it to 500 entries, previously it was unlimited.
Fixed a bug in the push command when pushing multiple expressions and improved error messages.

Mathomatic version 14.1.1 released 2008-07-30

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.1:

Documentation improvements.

8/5/08 - Added optional exit-value argument to quit command.

8/8/08 - Fixed a bug in the fraction command: the resulting algebraic fraction was not being fully reduced.

8/9/08 - Removed all of C type "long long" arithmetic from the main Mathomatic program,
         resulting in smaller executable.  "long long" types are only supported in C99.
         Tweaked startup messages and made quadratic solving consistent with other solving.
         Solving only unfactors as much as it needs to.

8/10/08 - Added "unfactor quick" command option.

Mathomatic version 14.1.2 released 2008-08-10

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.2:

Documentation improvements and bug fixes.

8/10/08 - Fixed a very old endless loop bug that occurred while simplifying.

8/11/08 - A few tweaks to factor the proper amount and made the fraction command work perfectly.

8/12/08 - Made bold_colors flag affect HTML color mode.

Mathomatic version 14.1.3 released 2008-08-13

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.3:

8/13/08 - The calculate command now reports the number of solutions.

8/14/08 - Made some big improvements and bug fixes to simplification, if only someone had reported bugs earlier!
          A major, long-standing simplify command malfunction has been fixed, but it runs a little slower.
          The simplify command is now logically correct and appears to work nicely now, please tell me if not.

Mathomatic version 14.1.4 released 2008-08-14

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.4:

Cleanup and beautification.

8/19/08 - Added "HANDHELD" C preprocessor define for when compiling for hand-helds, like the Nintendo DS.

8/21/08 - Fixed redirected debug output.
          Tuned up simplify command to work with larger expressions by automatically reducing the expansion if needed.

Mathomatic version 14.1.5 released 2008-08-24

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.5:

8/25/08 - Added "tests/electronics.in" Mathomatic input file; contains simple electrical formulas.
          When using m4, corrected ceil(x) function and added cbrt(x) (cube root function) in "m4/functions.m4".

9/02/08 - General internal routine get_constant() in "complex.c" was finished perfectly,
          making less need to ever approximate constants.
          Some corrections to the makefile were made, "make install" and "make m4install" were improved.

9/06/08 - Optimized "tests/linear.in" and "tests/poly.in" to make "make test" run in half the time.

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.1.6:

General cleanup.

9/11/08 - Fixed solving things like 2^(1/2) = e#^x for x, they failed before.

9/13/08 - The m4 "math" script now allows files to be read in by specifying them on the command line.

9/25/08 - 0 to the power of a negative number now consistently returns infinity with a divide by zero warning.

Mathomatic version 14.2.0 released 2008-09-25

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.2.0:

Documentation improvements: nintegrate command doc made sensible, etc.

10/4/08 - Moved icons and "mathomatic.desktop" to new directory "icons" in source distribution.

10/7/08 - Improved compare command while adding a new "symbolic" option to it.

10/12/08 - Added "set prompt" option, allowing you to turn on and off Mathomatic prompt output like the "-q" option.

Mathomatic version 14.2.1 released 2008-10-15

CHANGES MADE TO MATHOMATIC V14.2.1:
