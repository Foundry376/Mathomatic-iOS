.TH matho-primes 1

.SH NAME
matho-primes \- generate consecutive prime numbers

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B matho-primes
[start [stop]] ["twin"] ["pal" [base]]
.br
.B matho-primes
[\-t] [\-p base] [start [stop]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility is part of the
.BR mathomatic (1)
package.
It quickly computes any number of consecutive prime numbers using a memory efficient
sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, dumping them to standard output.
Generates up to 19 digit primes.
They are displayed one prime per line in ascending order,
unless the "twin" option is specified,
which displays two primes per line.

A range may be
specified on the command line, otherwise the starting number and
the number of primes to output is prompted for.
The range is "start" to "stop", inclusive, and "stop" must
be greater than or equal to "start".

If "\-t" or "twin" is specified on the command line, only twin primes will be displayed.
Twin primes are two primes that differ in value by 2.
Each twin pair is displayed together on the same line separated by a space character.

If "\-p" or "pal" is specified at the end of the command line, only palindromic primes are displayed.
Palindromes are symmetrical, they read exactly the same forward and backward.
The palindromic number base may be specified, the default is base 10.
The base can be any integer greater than 1.
