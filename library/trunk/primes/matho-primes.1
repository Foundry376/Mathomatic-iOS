.TH MATHO-PRIMES 1

.SH NAME
matho-primes \- generate consecutive prime numbers

[start [stop]] ["twin"] ["pal" [base]]

[\-ht] [\-c count] [\-p base] [start [stop]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This command-line utility is optionally part of the
.BR mathomatic (1)
package.
It quickly computes any number of consecutive prime numbers
using a windowing, memory efficient
sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, dumping them to standard output.
They are displayed one prime per line in ascending order,
unless the "twin" option is specified,
which displays only twin primes, two primes per line.

Generates up to 18 decimal digit primes,
or whatever is the number of digits of precision for a
.B long double
in the C compiler used to compile this utility.
All numbers displayed by this utility
are guaranteed to be decimal (base 10) prime numbers.
A prime number is an integer that cannot be factored.

A range may be
specified on the command line, otherwise the starting number and
the number of primes to output is prompted for.
The range is
.B start
to
.B stop
inclusive, and
.B stop
must
be greater than or equal to
.B start.

If the
.B \-c
option is specified, the number of lines of primes displayed is limited to the
decimal count that follows this option.

If the
.B \-t
or "twin" option is specified on the command line,
only
.B twin primes
will be displayed.
Twin primes are two primes that differ in value by 2.
Each twin pair is displayed together on the same line separated by a space character.

If the
.B \-p
or "pal" option is specified on the command line,
only
.B palindromic primes
are displayed.
Palindromes are symmetrical, they read exactly the same forward and backward.
The palindromic number
.B base
may be specified, the default is base 10.
The
.B base
can be any integer greater than 1.
Primes are always displayed in decimal (base 10).

Short help is displayed when given the
.B \-h
option.
