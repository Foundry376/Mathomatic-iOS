.SH DESCRIPTION
Mathomatic is a general-purpose CAS (Computer Algebra System) and calculator software
that can symbolically solve, simplify, combine, and compare equations,
perform complex number and polynomial arithmetic, etc.
It does some calculus and handles all elementary algebra, except logarithms.

Mathomatic is entirely hand-written in optimized C.
It does not permit extremely large expressions, which can take a lot of memory and time.
Instead reliability, ease of use, and speed are its features.

All arithmetic is double precision floating point
with up to 14 decimal digits accuracy.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Toggle color mode.
This mode outputs ANSI terminal escape sequences to make each level of
parentheses a different color, for easier reading.
Requires a terminal emulator that supports ANSI color escape sequences.
If the colors are too hard to see, try typing "set bold" at the Mathomatic prompt
to increase the brightness.

.TP
.B \-h
Enable HTML output mode (which is also valid XHTML).
This makes Mathomatic output suitable for inclusion in a web page.
The color mode and bold flags affect this mode, allowing HTML color output.

.TP
.B \-m number
Change the memory size of equation spaces.
It is followed by a decimal floating point number which is a multiplier
of the default equation space size.
Please don't set this higher than 10, unless you know what you are doing.

.TP
.B \-q
Set quiet mode.
The startup message and prompts are not displayed.
This is useful when piping or redirecting input into Mathomatic,
because the input won't be displayed,
so prompt output should be turned off.

.TP
.B \-r
Disable readline input processing.
Readline allows using the cursor keys and outputs terminal control codes
which can be turned off with this option.

.TP
.B \-t
Set test mode.
Used when testing and comparing output.
Bypasses loading startup file, turns off color mode and readline,
sets infinite screen width and height, ignores pause command, etc.

.TP
.B \-u
Guarantee that standard output and standard error output are unbuffered.

.TP
.B \-v
Display version number, compile flags used, maximum possible memory usage,
and license, then exit.

.SH GENERAL
First you type in your algebraic equations in standard infix notation,
then you can solve them by typing in the variable name at the prompt, or
perform operations on them with simple English commands.
Type "help" or "?" for the help command.
If the command is longer than 4 letters, you only need
to type in the first 4 letters.
Most commands operate on the current equation by default.

A command preceded by an exclamation point ("!") is taken to
be a shell command and is passed unchanged to the shell (/bin/sh).
"!" by itself invokes the default shell, which is specified in the SHELL environment variable.
"!" is also the factorial operator.

Complete documentation is available in HTML format;
see the local documentation directory or "http://mathomatic.org/math/doc/"
for the latest Mathomatic documentation.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B EDITOR
The EDITOR environment variable specifies which text editor to use for the edit command.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.mathomaticrc
Optional startup file containing Mathomatic set command options.
It should be a text file with one set option per line.
Do not include the word "set".

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR matho-primes (1),
.BR matho-pascal (1),
.BR matho-sumsq (1)

.SH BUGS
The command to take the limit of a function is partially functional and experimental.
All else should work perfectly; If not,
report it via email to George Gesslein II <georgegesslein@gmail.com>.
Please include version information, which you can find by running
.B mathomatic \-v
or by entering the version command.
