.SH DESCRIPTION
Mathomatic is a general-purpose computer algebra system (CAS)
that can symbolically solve, simplify, combine, and compare algebraic equations,
perform complex number and polynomial arithmetic, etc.
It does some calculus and handles all elementary algebra, except logarithms.
Plotting expressions with Gnuplot is also supported.

.B mathomatic
is the main Mathomatic application that does interactive symbolic-numeric mathematics
through a simple command-line interface.
The numeric arithmetic is double precision floating point
with about 14 decimal digits accuracy.
Many results will be exact, because multiple floating point numbers
can be combined for a single mathematical value; for example:
.B 2^(1/3),
which is the cubed root of 2 exactly.

.B rmath
is a shell script that allows you
to use Mathomatic with input of functions like
.B sin(x)
and
.B sqrt(x)
automatically expanded to equivalent algebraic expressions
by the
.B m4
macro processor.
The elapsed time, the CPU time, and the system time of the Mathomatic process are displayed in seconds upon exit.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
Enable bold colors.
Color mode will be turned on and colors will be brighter if this option is specified.
Same as the "set bold color" command.

.TP
.B \-c
Toggle color mode.
This mode outputs ANSI terminal escape sequences to make each level of
parentheses a different color, for easier reading.
Requires a terminal emulator that supports ANSI color escape sequences.
If the colors are too hard to see, use the
.B \-b
option to increase the brightness.

.TP
.B \-e
Process mathematical expressions and Mathomatic commands
instead of input files on the shell command line.
Unquoted space characters are the line separators
on the Mathomatic input that follows this option.
Works similar to entering it into the Mathomatic main prompt,
except the autoselect option is turned off.
Useful for quick command-line calculations.
The startup messages are not displayed with this option.
Precede all expressions with a single "--" so that
expressions can start with a minus sign (-).

.TP
.B \-h
Display a brief help message listing all of these options and then exit.

.TP
.B \-m number
Change the memory size of equation spaces.
It is followed by a decimal floating point number which is a multiplier
of the default equation space size.
This allows larger equation spaces so that manipulating extremely
large expressions will succeed without getting the
"Expression too large" error.
Specifying a number higher than 100 may make Mathomatic unresponsive.

.TP
.B \-q
Set quiet mode.
The startup messages and prompts are not displayed.
This is useful when piping or redirecting input into Mathomatic,
because the input won't be displayed,
so prompt output should be turned off.
This option does the same thing as the "set no prompt" command.

.TP
.B \-r
Disable readline input processing.
Readline allows using the cursor keys and outputs terminal control codes
which can be turned off with this option.

.TP
.B \-s level
Set the enforced security level for the Mathomatic session.
Level 0 is the default with no security.
Level 1 disallows shelling out.
Level 2 disallows shelling out and writing files.
Level 3 disallows shelling out and reading/writing files for complete security.
This run-time option was created for use on open public servers
that can't use the SECURE compile-time define.

.TP
.B \-t
Set test mode.
Used when testing and comparing output.
Bypasses loading startup (rc) file, turns off color mode and readline,
sets wide output mode, ignores pause command, etc.

.TP
.B \-u
Guarantee that standard output and standard error output are unbuffered.
Also echoes all line input if not in quiet mode (\-q).
Useful when piping.

.TP
.B \-v
Display version number, compilation options used,
maximum possible memory usage, then exit.

.TP
.B \-w
Set wide output mode for an unlimited width output device
like the "set wide" command does.
Sets infinite screen columns and rows so that 2D (two dimensional)
expression output will always succeed
and not be downgraded to 1D output when it doesn't fit in the display area.
Use when redirecting output or with a terminal emulator that doesn't wrap lines.
This mode only affects 2D output.

.TP
.B \-x
Enable HTML output mode (which is also valid XHTML).
This makes Mathomatic output suitable for inclusion in a web page.
The color mode and bold colors flags affect this mode, allowing HTML color output.
Wide output mode is also set by this option, meaning expressions
will always be displayed in 2D.

.SH GENERAL
After any options, text files may be specified on the shell command line
that will be automatically read in with the read command, unless the
.B \-e
option is specified.

Mathomatic is best run from within a terminal emulator.
It uses console line input and output for the user interface.
First you type in your mathematical equations in standard infix notation,
then you can solve them by typing in the variable name at the prompt, or
perform operations on them with simple English commands.
Type "help" or "?" for the help command.
If the command is longer than 4 letters, you only need
to type in the first 4 letters.
Most commands operate on the current equation by default.

A command preceded by an exclamation point (such as "!ls") is taken to
be a shell command and is passed unchanged to the shell (/bin/sh).
"!" by itself invokes the default shell, which is specified in the SHELL environment variable.
"!" is also the factorial operator.

Complete documentation is available in HTML format;
see the local documentation directory or online at "http://mathomatic.org/math/doc/"
for the latest Mathomatic documentation.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B EDITOR
The EDITOR environment variable specifies which text editor to use for the edit command.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.mathomaticrc
Optional startup file containing Mathomatic set command options.
It should be a text file with one set option per line.
Do not include the word "set".  For example,
the line "no color" will make Mathomatic default to non-color mode,
which is useful if you aren't using a standard ANSI terminal emulator.
"rc" stands for "run cold".

.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
The command to take the limit of an expression is partially functional and experimental.
All else should work perfectly; if not,
please report it as a bug to the author or
on the Launchpad website: "https://launchpad.net/mathomatic".
