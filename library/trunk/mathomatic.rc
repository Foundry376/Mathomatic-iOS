; Mathomatic configuration file for MS-Windows only.
; Other systems use "~/.mathomaticrc".
; This file belongs in the same directory as "mathomatic.exe".

; You can use this file to permanently configure "set" variables, like:

bold ; sets bold_colors on

; To see the current configuration when using Mathomatic type
; "set" at the command prompt (without double quotes).
