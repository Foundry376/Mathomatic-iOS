; Equations are entered by just typing them in:
c^2=a^2+b^2 ; The Pythagorean theorem
; The entered equation becomes the current equation.
; The current equation is solved by typing in a variable name:
c ; Solve for c.
; "sign" variables are special two-valued variables that may only be +1 or -1
b ; Solve for b.
; To generate C programming language code, use the code command:
code C

code java ; Mathomatic can also generate Java

code python ; and Python code.

; ********************************************************************
a=b+1/b ; enter another equation
solve verify b ; solve for "b", verifying the result
a ; solve back for "a" and we should get the original equation
simplify ; The simplify command makes expressions simpler and prettier.
; ********************************************************************
; Mathomatic is also handy as a calculator.
; Expressions without variables are instantly evaluated:
2+3
2^.5 ; the square root of 2, rounded to 14 digits:
; ********************************************************************
27^y=9 ; an example that uses numerical logarithms
solve verify y ; Solve for y, verifying the result.
; ********************************************************************
0=x^2+x ; A simple quadratic, to show how the calculate command works.
solve verify x ; Solve for x, verifying the result.
calculate ; expand "sign" variables and approximate
