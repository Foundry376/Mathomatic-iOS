; Tests for the experimental limit command.

clear all
; find the derivative of 1/(x^.5) using the difference quotient:
(1/(x+delta_x)^.5-1/x^.5)/delta_x
limit delta_x 0 ; take the limit as delta_x (change in x) goes to 0
2
integrate x ; take the antiderivative to see if it's right

; test infinity limits:
2x/(x+1)
limit x inf ; answer should be 2

(3x+100-a)/(x-b)
limit x inf ; answer should be 3

(((x^2) - (5*x) + 6)^(1/2)) - x
limit x inf ; answer should be -5/2

x*((x^2+1)^.5-x)
limit x inf ; answer should be 1/2

1/x^2+1/x
limit x inf ; result should be 0

; The following currently give wrong answers:
x^2+x
limit x inf ; result should be inf
