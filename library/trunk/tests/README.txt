This directory contains only Mathomatic scripts.  They include tests,
examples, short tutorials, and educational math toys.

 	To run all tests, type "mathomatic all".
	For a short, educational demo, type "mathomatic heron".

Look around and have fun!  Feel free to contribute your Mathomatic scripts.
Here are the good examples and lessons that are available in this directory:
