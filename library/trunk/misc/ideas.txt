                         Ideas to code in Mathomatic
                         ---------------------------

Simplify nested radicals like ((9 + 4*(2^.5))^.5) to (1 + 2*(2^.5)).  This
may be difficult, I don't know how this is generally done.  Heuristics are
not acceptable for this.  Test expression:

  ((2+(3^.5))/((2^.5)+(2+(3^.5))^.5)+(2-(3^.5))/((2^.5)-(2-(3^.5))^.5))^2

should simplify to 2.

Use the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) to automatically numerically solve any
degree numeric polynomial equation, like "polyroots.c" does, when symbolic
solving fails.  Unfortunately, this will make Mathomatic dependent on the
GSL, so I may not do this.

Implement complex number factorials, when an accurate floating point complex
number gamma calculating function is found.  The GSL does this.

Have "solve verify" verify individual solutions instead of the whole set of
solutions at once.  This will show which solutions are correct instead of
just saying yes or no.
