                      Mathomatic Installation Instructions
                      ------------------------------------

The requirements for easy installation from this source code are: a make
utility and the gcc C compiler.  Other C compilers may be used, but may
require small changes to the makefile and sources.  You will need to open a
shell window to compile and run Mathomatic.  Under Mac OS X, the required
compilation software is included in Xcode Tools on your installation discs.
Mathomatic has been tested and easily installs under Unix, Linux, Mac OS X,
and Cygwin for MS-Windows.

Root (super-user) or administrator permissions are needed to install
Mathomatic, because write permission is needed to copy files into the
directories in "/usr/local".

A typical installation is done by typing the following at the shell prompt:

	make READLINE=1
	make test
	sudo make install

This will compile, test, and install the Mathomatic executable and docs in
"/usr/local" in less than a minute.  After this, typing "man mathomatic"
should bring up the man page, and typing "mathomatic" should run Mathomatic.
If Mathomatic doesn't run, check that the shell PATH environment variable
includes "/usr/local/bin" with the command "echo $PATH".

To install in "/usr" instead of "/usr/local", type:

	sudo make prefix=/usr install

If sudo doesn't work, login as root or type:

	su -c "make install"

and enter the root password to install as the super-user.

To install the Mathomatic GNU m4 script that allows math functions as macros,
use "make m4install" instead of "make install".

To undo the installation and remove Mathomatic from the local computer, type:

	sudo make uninstall
