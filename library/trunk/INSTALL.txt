                      Mathomatic Installation Instructions
                      ------------------------------------

The requirements for easy installation from this source code are: the GNU
make utility and the GNU C compiler (gcc).  Other C compilers may be used,
but may require small changes to the makefile and sources.  You will need to
open a shell window to compile and run Mathomatic.  Under Mac OS X, the
required compilation software is included in Xcode Tools, which is available
on one of your Mac OS X installation discs.

Mathomatic has been tested and easily compiles and installs under Unix,
Linux, Mac OS X, and under the Cygwin environment for MS-Windows.
Precompiled packages are also available for the above mainstream operating
systems and for many Linux distributions from the Mathomatic web site
(http://mathomatic.org) and from your operating system's package manager.

Root (super-user) or administrator permission is needed to install
Mathomatic, because write permission is needed to copy files into the
directories in "/usr/local".  Mathomatic need not be installed to run the
compiled executable.

A typical installation is done by typing the following at the shell prompt:

	make READLINE=1
	make test
	sudo make install

This will compile the source code, verify the functionality of the generated
executable (named "mathomatic"), and install the executable, docs, and tests
in "/usr/local" in less than a minute.  After this, typing "man mathomatic"
should bring up the man page, and typing "mathomatic" should run Mathomatic.
If Mathomatic doesn't run, check that the PATH environment variable includes
"/usr/local/bin" with the shell command "echo $PATH".

To install in "/usr" instead of "/usr/local", type:

	sudo make prefix=/usr install

If sudo doesn't work, login as root or type:

	su -c "make install"

and enter the root password to install as the super-user.

To install everything, including m4 Mathomatic, which allows easy entry of
math functions like sqrt(x) and sin(x) as macros, use "make m4install"
instead of "make install".

To undo the installation and remove Mathomatic from the local computer, type:

	sudo make uninstall
