The Debian Menu System provides a unified menu interface for both text and
X Windows oriented programs, without having to configure each window manager.

  These are the Debian Menu System files for Mathomatic.
  "mathomatic" and "mathomatic-primes" go in "/usr/share/menu".
  They should be put there by the Debian mathomatic package.
