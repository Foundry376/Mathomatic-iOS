.SH DESCRIPTION
Mathomatic is a general-purpose computer algebra system (CAS)
that can symbolically solve, simplify, combine, and compare algebraic equations,
perform standard, complex number, modular, and polynomial arithmetic, etc.
It does some calculus and handles all elementary algebra, except logarithms.
Plotting expressions with
.B gnuplot
is also supported.

.B rmath
and
.B matho
are shell scripts that allow you
to use Mathomatic with input of functions like
.BI sin (x)
and
.BI sqrt (x)
automatically expanded to equivalent algebraic expressions
by the
.B m4
macro preprocessor.
A matching pair of parentheses is required around the parameters for all functions in m4 Mathomatic; m4 requires this.
.B rmath
also runs the
.B rlwrap
readline wrapper utility if available, to provide readline input editing support similar to
that provided by
.BR mathomatic (1).

.B rmath
and
.B matho
define and enable named math functions in Mathomatic.
Most functions enabled here should be real number, complex number, and symbolically capable.
One exception is the
.BI abs (x)
function, which doesn't work with complex numbers, because it is defined
in Mathomatic as (((x)^2)^.5).

The following general functions are defined when using
.B rmath
or
.B matho:
.BI sqrt (x),
.BI cbrt (x),
.BI exp (x),
.BI pow (x,y),
.BI abs (x),
.BI sgn (x),
.BI gamma (x),
.BI floor (x),
.BI ceil (x),
.BI int (x),
and
.BI round (x).

The following standard trigonometric functions are defined:
.BI sin (x),
.BI cos (x),
.BI tan (x),
.BI cot (x),
.BI sec (x),
and
.BI csc (x).
.BI sinc (x)
is the normalized sinc function, defined as
.BI sin (pi*x) /(pi*x) .

The following standard hyperbolic trigonometric functions are defined:
.BI sinh (x),
.BI cosh (x),
.BI tanh (x),
.BI coth (x),
.BI sech (x),
and
.BI csch (x).

The following named binary operators are defined:
.B mod
for modulus.  This operator is the same as the % operator.

The following universal constants are defined:
.I pi,
.I e,
.I i
(the imaginary unit),
.I euler
(the Euler-Mascheroni constant),
.I omega,
and
.I phi
(the golden ratio).

.SH GENERAL
Text files may be specified on the shell command line
that will be automatically read in through the m4 preprocessor into Mathomatic.
After any files are read in, Mathomatic prompts for input from the console.

Mathomatic is best run from within a terminal emulator.
It uses console line input and output for the user interface.
First you type in your mathematical equations in standard algebraic notation,
then you can solve them by typing in the variable name at the prompt, or
perform operations on them with simple English commands.
Type "help" or "?" for the help command,
"help examples" to get started.
If the command name is longer than 4 letters, you only need
to type in the first 4 letters.
Most commands operate on the current equation by default.

Complete documentation is available in HTML and PDF formats;
see the local documentation directory or online at "http://mathomatic.org/math/doc/"
for the latest Mathomatic documentation.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.mathomaticrc
Optional startup file containing Mathomatic set command options.
It should be a text file with one set option per line.
Do not include the word "set".  For example,
the line "no color" will make Mathomatic default to non-color mode,
which is useful if you aren't using a standard ANSI terminal emulator.
