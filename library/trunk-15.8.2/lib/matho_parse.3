.SH NAME
\fBmatho_parse \fP- Process Mathomatic expression or equation input
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
int \fBmatho_parse\fP(char *\fIinput\fP, char **\fIoutputp\fP);
.fam T
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
Parse a mathematical equation or expression and store in the next available equation space,
making it the current equation.
Afterwards, it can be operated on by Mathomatic commands using \fBmatho_process\fP(3).
.PP
The \fIinput\fP and output ASCII strings are expressions, if successful.
The expression or equation string to enter is in "\fIinput\fP",
the resulting output string is stored in "*\fIoutputp\fP".
The equation number of the equation space that the output expression
is additionally stored in (if any) is available in the global "result_en",
otherwise result_en = \fB-1\fP.
.PP
Works the same as \fBmatho_process\fP(3), except commands are not allowed,
so that variables are not ever confused with commands.
.PP
Returns true (non-zero) if successful.
