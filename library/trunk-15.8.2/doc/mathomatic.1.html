<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
Mathomatic
is a general-purpose computer algebra system (CAS) that can symbolically
solve, simplify, combine, and compare algebraic equations, perform standard,
complex number, modular, and polynomial arithmetic, etc. It does some calculus
and handles all elementary algebra, except logarithms. Trigonometry and
function expansion are supported in a separate program called <a href='rmath.1.html'><b>rmath</b>(1)</a>
.
Plotting expressions with <b>gnuplot</b> is also supported. 
<p> <b>mathomatic</b> is the
main Mathomatic application that does interactive symbolic-numeric mathematics
through a simple command-line interface. Readline support is usually compiled
into this application, making it easy to edit input and recall previous
input with the cursor keys. The numeric arithmetic is double precision floating
point with about 14 decimal digits accuracy. Many results will be exact,
because symbolic math is an exact math, and because multiple floating point
numbers can be combined for a single mathematical value; for example: <b>2^(1/3),</b>
which is the cube root of 2 exactly. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>-b</b> </dt>
<dd>Enable bold colors. Color
mode will be turned on and colors will be brighter if this option is specified.
Same as the "set bold color" command. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-c</b> </dt>
<dd>Toggle color mode. This mode outputs
ANSI terminal escape sequences to make each level of parentheses a different
color, for easier reading. Requires a terminal emulator that supports ANSI
color escape sequences. If the colors are too hard to see, use the <b>-b</b> option
to increase the color brightness. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-e</b> </dt>
<dd>Process mathematical expressions and
Mathomatic commands instead of input files on the shell command line, and
then quit. Unquoted space characters are the line separators on the Mathomatic
input that follows this option. Works similar to entering it into the Mathomatic
main prompt, except the autoselect option is turned off. Useful for quick
command-line calculations. The startup messages are not displayed with this
option. Follow this option with "--" so that expressions can start with a
minus sign (-). 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-h</b> </dt>
<dd>Display a brief help message listing all of these options
and then exit. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-m number</b> </dt>
<dd>Change the memory size of equation spaces. It is
followed by a decimal, floating point number which is a multiplier of the
default equation space size. This allows larger equation spaces so that
manipulating extremely large expressions will succeed without getting the
"Expression too large" error. Specifying a number higher than 100 may make
Mathomatic unresponsive. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-q</b> </dt>
<dd>Set quiet mode. The startup messages and prompts
are not displayed. This is useful when piping or redirecting input into
Mathomatic, because the input won&rsquo;t be displayed, so prompt output should
be turned off. This option does the same thing as the "set no prompt" command.

<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-r</b> </dt>
<dd>Disable readline input processing. Readline allows line input editing
using the cursor keys, and outputs terminal control codes, all of which
can be turned off with this option. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-s level</b> </dt>
<dd>Set the enforced security level
for the Mathomatic session. Level 0 is the default with no security. Level
1 disallows shelling out (forking). Level 2 disallows shelling out and writing
files. Level 3 disallows shelling out and reading/writing files. Level 4
is the highest security level and is the same as compiling with the -DSECURE
option. This run-time option was created for use on open public servers. 
<p>
</dd>

<dt><b>-t</b> </dt>
<dd>Set test mode. Used when testing and comparing output. Bypasses loading
startup (rc) file, turns off color mode and readline, sets wide output
mode, ignores pause command, etc. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-u</b> </dt>
<dd>Guarantee that standard output and
standard error output are unbuffered. Also echoes all line input if not
in quiet mode ( <b>-q</b> option ). Useful when piping. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-v</b> </dt>
<dd>Display version number,
compilation options used, expression array size, maximum possible memory
usage, and security level, then exit. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-w</b> </dt>
<dd>Set wide output mode for an unlimited
width output device like the "set wide" command does. Sets infinite screen
columns and rows so that 2D (two-dimensional) expression output will always
succeed and not be downgraded to 1D output when it doesn&rsquo;t fit in the display
area. Use when redirecting output or with a terminal emulator that doesn&rsquo;t
wrap lines. This mode only affects 2D output. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>-x</b> </dt>
<dd>Enable HTML output mode
(which is also valid XHTML). This makes Mathomatic output suitable for inclusion
in a web page. Color and bold mode affect this mode, allowing HTML color
output. Wide output mode is also set by this option, meaning expressions
will always be displayed in 2D. 
<p> </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>General</a></h2>
After any options, text files may
be specified on the shell command line that will be automatically read
in with the read command, unless the <b>-e</b> option is specified. 
<p> Mathomatic
is best run from within a terminal emulator. It uses console line input
and output for the user interface. First you type in your mathematical equations
in standard algebraic notation, then you can solve them by typing in the
variable name at the prompt, or perform operations on them with simple
English commands. Type "help" or "?" for the help command, "help examples"
to get started. If the command name is longer than 4 letters, you only need
to type in the first 4 letters. Most commands operate on the current equation
by default. 
<p> A command preceded by an exclamation point (such as "!ls")
is taken to be a shell command and is passed unchanged to the shell (/bin/sh).
"!" by itself invokes the default shell, which is specified in the SHELL
environment variable. "!" is also the factorial operator. 
<p> Complete documentation
is available in HTML and PDF formats; see the local documentation directory
or online at "<a href='http://mathomatic.org/math/doc/'>http://mathomatic.org/math/doc/</a>
" for the latest Mathomatic
documentation.

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Environment</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>EDITOR</b> </dt>
<dd>The EDITOR environment variable specifies
which text editor to use for the edit command. 
<p> </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Files</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>~/.mathomaticrc</b> </dt>
<dd>Optional
startup file containing Mathomatic set command options. It should be a text
file with one set option per line. Do not include the word "set".  For example,
the line "no color" will make Mathomatic default to non-color mode, which
is useful if you aren&rsquo;t using a standard ANSI terminal emulator.

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Reporting Bugs</a></h2>
The command to take the limit
of an expression is partially functional and experimental. All else should
work perfectly; if not, please report it as a bug to the author or on the
Launchpad website: "<a href='https://launchpad.net/mathomatic'>https://launchpad.net/mathomatic</a>
