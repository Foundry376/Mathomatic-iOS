; Combine 4 simultaneous linear equations with 4 unknowns (x1, x2, x3, x4).
; Solve for all 4 unknowns using the eliminate, solve, and simplify commands.

; Keep this to test simplification in Mathomatic when recursion is added to the GCD routines.
; Currently Mathomatic is unable to completely simplify all of the resulting equations.
; By using the simplify command immediately after some eliminate commands,
; equation number 4 solved for x4 is completely simplified.
;
; The rest may be easily simplifiable when polynomial GCD works recursively,
; so that it is multivariate.
